# quad-tree-impl

A quad tree implementation in Standard ML.

This quad tree is specialised for the tile merging and image decomposition problems described in [this article](https://hummy123.github.io/2025/07/09/Tile-Merging-Quad-Trees.html).

These problems do not involve overlapping items at the leaves of a quad tree, making this particular implementation unsuitable for general use for other problems.
